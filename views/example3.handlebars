                                Count Olaf was a very <strong>{{submissions.w1}} </strong> superhero.
                                He had a <strong>{{submissions.w2}} </strong> that was so strong it could even lift <strong>{{submissions.w3}} </strong>.
                                He was even more powerful if he had on his <strong>{{submissions.w4}} </strong> cape. Which was given to him by
                                the Grand <strong>{{submissions.w5}} </strong> of America. One time he even saved the entire <strong>{{submissions.w6}} </strong>with only his
                                trusty <strong>{{submissions.w7}} </strong>.
                                Not to mention the time he rescued the bus full of <strong>{{submissions.w8}} </strong>  by
                                <strong>{{submissions.w9}} </strong> throwing the bus to safety. For his bravery the mayor of his city gave him the
                                <strong>{{submissions.w10}} </strong> to the city!
